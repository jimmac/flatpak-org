## Install Flatpak

To install Flatpak, run the following in a terminal:

```
sudo neko em flatpak
```

## Add the Flathub repository

Flathub is the best place to get Flatpak apps. To enable it, run:

```
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

## Restart
To complete setup, restart your system. Now all you have to do is [install some apps](https://flathub.org)!
