Flatpak is installed by default on PureOS. To get started, all you need to do is enable Flathub, which is the best way to get Flatpak apps. Just download and install the [Flathub repository file](https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo). 

Now all you have to do is [install some apps](https://flathub.org)!
